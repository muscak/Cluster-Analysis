This study is to practice the Unsupervised Learning section (Chapter 7) of [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781492072935/) book. We'll give some information about Principal Component Analysis, $k$-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and Model-Based Clustering using Python on Jupyter Notebook.

Clustering methods can be used to identify meaningful groups of data. For example, using the web clicks and demographic data of a user on a website, we may be able to group together different types of users [^2].
